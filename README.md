# SnapOut

**Mission Statement**

*At SnapOut, our mission is to help professionals break free from the perpetual cycle of work‑consume‑repeat so they can build diversified income, align their careers with passion, and gain the time and agency to live life on their own terms.*

**About**

SnapOut is an early-stage project designed to help people escape the rat race through a combination of mindset, systems, and digital tools. Whether you're exploring financial independence, launching a side hustle, or just want to regain control of your time, SnapOut is here to support that journey.

This is a public repo built by a passionate developer currently focused on landing a new software engineering job. But if that doesn’t work out, this project may evolve into a full startup.
